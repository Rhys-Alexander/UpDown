This is a hackathon project made alone by yours truly in one 7 hour working day.

I was awarded the prize for the best project highlighting my impressive UI as well as the best presentation.

The task was to build an app which received as input
- a stock
- a date
- and an amont invested

And it would return your profit or Loss.

I built on this with tables and graphs to show how you're investment has fluctuated as well as comparing it with other popular stocks. It stores your recent history so you can click back at the ivestments you've made. If you want to share your investment's earnings you can hit one button to post it to twitter/X.
